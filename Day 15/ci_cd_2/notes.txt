 1. Introduction

 1.1 What is CI/CD

CI/CD stands for:

 CI — Continuous Integration
 CD — Continuous Delivery / Continuous Deployment

It is a process used in software development to automatically build, test, and deploy code changes.

 Continuous Integration (CI)

Continuous Integration is the practice of automatically integrating code changes into a shared repository and verifying them through automated builds and tests.

Key goals:

 Detect bugs early
 Ensure code works correctly
 Maintain stable codebase

Example workflow:

1. Developer writes code
2. Developer pushes code to Git repository
3. CI system automatically:

    Pulls the code
    Installs dependencies
    Runs tests
    Reports success/failure

---

 Continuous Delivery (CD)

Continuous Delivery ensures that the code is always in a deployable state.

It automatically:

 Builds the application
 Packages it
 Prepares it for deployment

Deployment may require manual approval.

---

 Continuous Deployment (CD)

Continuous Deployment goes one step further and automatically deploys the application without manual intervention.

Example:

```
Code Push → Test → Build → Deploy → Live automatically
```

---

 Simple CI/CD Pipeline Flow

```
Developer → Git Push → CI (Test) → Build → Deploy → Production
```

---

 1.2 Importance of CI/CD in Modern Development

CI/CD is essential in modern software development for the following reasons:

 1. Faster Development

 Automates repetitive tasks
 Reduces manual work
 Speeds up release cycles

 2. Early Bug Detection

 Automated tests detect bugs immediately
 Prevents broken code from reaching production

 3. Improved Code Quality

 Enforces testing and validation
 Ensures stable code

 4. Reduced Deployment Risk

 Automated deployment reduces human error
 Ensures consistent deployment process

 5. Faster Feedback

 Developers know quickly if code works or fails

 6. Automation

Eliminates manual tasks like:

 Running tests
 Building applications
 Deploying applications

 1.3 Why Use Python for CI/CD

Python is an excellent choice for building CI/CD pipelines because of its simplicity and powerful automation capabilities.

 1. Easy to Learn and Use

Python has simple syntax:

```python
print("Running pipeline")
```

Compared to complex shell scripts, Python is easier to maintain.

---

 2. Strong Automation Capabilities

Python can automate:

 Running tests
 Building applications
 Copying files
 Deploying applications
 Monitoring systems

Example:

```python
import subprocess
subprocess.run(["pytest"])
```

---

 3. Cross-Platform Support

Python works on:

 Windows
 Linux
 macOS

No need to rewrite scripts.

---

 4. Large Ecosystem of Libraries

Useful libraries include:

 subprocess → run commands
 os → file operations
 shutil → copy files
 pytest → testing
 requests → API calls
 fabric → remote deployment

---

 5. Easy Integration with Tools

Python integrates with:

 Git
 Docker
 Cloud services
 Servers

---

 6. Better Error Handling

Python provides clear error handling:

```python
try:
    run_pipeline()
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
```

---

 1.4 Overview of Python-Based Automation

Python automation means using Python scripts to perform tasks automatically without manual intervention.

In a Python-based CI/CD pipeline, Python controls the entire workflow.

---

 Typical Python CI/CD Pipeline Flow

```
Step 1: Pull latest code
Step 2: Install dependencies
Step 3: Run tests
Step 4: Build application
Step 5: Deploy application
Step 6: Log results
```

---

 Example Python Pipeline Script

```python
import subprocess

def install_dependencies():
    subprocess.run(["pip", "install", "-r", "requirements.txt"])

def run_tests():
    subprocess.run(["pytest"])

def build():
    print("Building application...")

def deploy():
    print("Deploying application...")

def main():
    install_dependencies()
    run_tests()
    build()
    deploy()
    print("Pipeline completed successfully")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

---

 Tasks Python Can Automate in CI/CD

 Pull code from Git
 Install dependencies
 Run tests
 Build artifacts
 Deploy applications
 Restart services
 Monitor deployment
 Generate logs

---
