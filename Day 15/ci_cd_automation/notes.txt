 1. Introduction to GitHub Actions

 1.1 What is GitHub Actions

 Automation platform inside GitHub
 Used for CI/CD and workflow automation

 1.2 Why Use GitHub Actions

 Automates build, test, deploy
 No external CI tool needed
 Integrated with GitHub repositories

 1.3 Benefits

 Built-in CI/CD
 Cloud hosted runners
 Easy integration
 Event-driven automation

---

 2. Core Concepts

 2.1 Workflow

 Automated process defined in YAML

Example:

```
.github/workflows/main.yml
```

 2.2 Events

Triggers that start workflows

Examples:

 push
 pull_request
 workflow_dispatch
 schedule

Example:

```yaml
on: push
```

---

 2.3 Jobs

 A workflow contains jobs
 Jobs run on runners

Example:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
```

---

 2.4 Steps

 Jobs contain steps

Example:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Checkout code
```

---

 2.5 Actions

Reusable automation units

Examples:

 checkout action
 setup-python action

---

 2.6 Runners

Machines that execute workflows

Types:

 GitHub hosted runner
 Self-hosted runner

Example:

```yaml
runs-on: ubuntu-latest
```

---

 3. Workflow File Structure

 3.1 Folder Structure

```
.github/
 └── workflows/
      └── pipeline.yml
```

---

 3.2 Basic Workflow Example

```yaml
name: Python CI Pipeline

on: push

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Install Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4

      - name: Run script
        run: python app.py
```

---

 4. Events and Triggers

 4.1 Push Event

```yaml
on: push
```

---

 4.2 Pull Request Event

```yaml
on: pull_request
```

---

 4.3 Manual Trigger

```yaml
on: workflow_dispatch
```

---

 4.4 Scheduled Trigger

```yaml
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0   '
```

Runs daily.

---

 5. Jobs and Steps

 5.1 Single Job Workflow

 5.2 Multiple Jobs Workflow

```yaml
jobs:
  test:
  build:
  deploy:
```

---

 5.3 Job Dependencies

```yaml
deploy:
  needs: build
```

---

 6. Using Actions

 6.1 Official Actions

Examples:

```
actions/checkout
actions/setup-python
actions/setup-node
```

---

 6.2 Marketplace Actions

GitHub Marketplace contains thousands of actions.

---

 7. Running Python in GitHub Actions

 7.1 Setup Python

```yaml
- uses: actions/setup-python@v4
  with:
    python-version: '3.11'
```

---

 7.2 Install Dependencies

```yaml
- run: pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

 7.3 Run Tests

```yaml
- run: pytest
```

---

 8. Environment Variables

 8.1 Define Environment Variables

```yaml
env:
  NAME: value
```

---

 8.2 Use Environment Variables

```yaml
run: echo $NAME
```

---

 9. Secrets Management

 9.1 GitHub Secrets

Used to store sensitive data:

 passwords
 tokens
 API keys

Example:

```
Settings → Secrets → Actions
```

---

 9.2 Use Secret in Workflow

```yaml
env:
  TOKEN: ${{ secrets.TOKEN }}
```

---

 10. Matrix Builds

Run jobs in multiple environments

Example:

```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    python-version: [3.9, 3.10, 3.11]
```

---

 11. Artifacts

Save files from workflows

Example:

```yaml
- uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
```

---

 12. Deployment Automation

Deploy to:

 Server
 AWS
 Azure
 Docker
 Kubernetes

Example:

```yaml
- run: python deploy.py
```

---

 13. Self-hosted Runners

Run workflows on your own server.

Benefits:

 Full control
 Custom environment

---

 14. Workflow Commands

Examples:

```
echo
export
set-env
```

---

 15. Conditional Execution

Example:

```yaml
if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
```

---

 16. Notifications

Send notifications via:

 Email
 Slack
 Discord

---

 17. Caching Dependencies

Example:

```yaml
- uses: actions/cache@v4
```

Improves speed.

---

 18. Custom Actions

Create your own reusable actions.

Types:

 JavaScript actions
 Docker actions
 Composite actions

---

 19. CI Pipeline with GitHub Actions

Steps:

```
Checkout code
Install dependencies
Run tests
Build project
Deploy project
```

---

 20. CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions

Steps:

```
Build
Package
Deploy
Verify deployment
```

---

 21. Monitoring and Logs

GitHub provides:

 Logs
 Execution time
 Status

---

 22. Security Best Practices

 Use secrets
 Avoid hardcoding passwords
 Use minimal permissions

---

 23. Real-World Python CI/CD Example Topics

 Run pytest automatically
 Build Python package
 Deploy to server
 Monitor workflow

---

 24. Advanced Topics

 Reusable workflows
 Composite actions
 Docker integration
 Kubernetes deployment
 Multi-environment deployment

---

 25. Integration Topics

GitHub Actions integrates with:

 Docker
 AWS
 Azure
 GCP
 Jenkins
 Kubernetes

---

 26. Automation Use Cases

 CI/CD pipelines
 Auto testing
 Auto deployment
 Scheduled jobs
 Code quality checks

---

 27. Best Practices

 Keep workflows simple
 Use caching
 Use secrets
 Use reusable workflows
